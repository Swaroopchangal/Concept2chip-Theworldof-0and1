# Concept2chip-Theworldof-0and1
This repository contains all about the world of semiconductor, from the initial concept to fabricating a hands on chip. This world is created with the help of weekly tasks assigned during the course of RISCâ€‘V Reference SoC Tapeout Program by VSD.
A typicall chip even the smallest takes the most proper planning as even the slighest margins cause the biggest of the problems so as a person who is involved in the design process one must be trained professionally and needs hands on experince before entering a organisation.
This course gives a complete idea about how a chip is made from sand to SOC and turns young freshers to trained freshers.
